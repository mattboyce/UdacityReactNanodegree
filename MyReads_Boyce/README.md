## Summry
This app provides a simple digital bookshelf for users to track their reading. Books may be categorized on to one of three shelves:

  - Currently Reading
  - Want to Read
  - Read

Users may move books between shelves at any time. They may also search for untracked books to add to a shelf by using the search page.
