## Summry
This app provides a platform for employees to submit questions with two voting options, vote on questions, and view voting results.

The app contains the following pages:

  - Login - where the user can log in to their own account
  - Home - which displays the polls the user has already answered, and has yet to answer
  - Leaderboard - which displays the top users determined by who has voted in and created the most polls
  - View Poll - which displays a question with an option to vote if the user has not voted, or displays the question's results if the user has already voted
